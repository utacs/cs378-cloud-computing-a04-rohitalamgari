# Running on Laptop

Prerequisite:

-   Maven 3

-   JDK 1.6 or higher

-   (If working with eclipse) Eclipse with m2eclipse plugin installed

The java main class is:

edu.cs.utexas.HadoopEx.WordCount

Input file: Book-Tiny.txt

Specify your own Output directory like

# Running:

## Running on GCP

-   Create the 3 separate Jar Files by changing the run command in Driver.java

-   Add them to your Cloud Storage or use gs://dtoor/task1.jar or task2-real.jar or task3-real.jar

-   Add the large file as the first argument

-   Add your intermediate folder on GS as the second

-   Add your output folder on GS as the third and final argument

## Create a JAR Using Maven

To compile the project and create a single jar file with all dependencies:
`	mvn clean package `

- To compile different tasks change the run() line inside Driver.java before running the command.

## Run your application

Inside your shell with Hadoop

Running as Java Application (for Task One on small):

`java -jar target/MapReduce-WordCount-example-0.1-SNAPSHOT-jar-with-dependencies.jar taxi-data-sorted-small.csv  output`

Running as Java Application (for Task Two or Three on small):

`java -jar target/MapReduce-WordCount-example-0.1-SNAPSHOT-jar-with-dependencies.jar taxi-data-sorted-small.csv intermediateFolder output`

Or has hadoop application

`hadoop jar your-hadoop-application.jar edu.cs.utexas.HadoopEx.WordCount arg0 arg1 ... `

## Create a single JAR File from eclipse

Create a single gar file with eclipse

-   File export -> export -> export as binary -> "Extract generated libraries into generated JAR"
